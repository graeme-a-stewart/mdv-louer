## Location

The house is situated in the southern part of Thoiry, in Fenières. There are
ample local shopping facilities in the Val Thoiry shopping centre. Geneva (CERN)
is just a 10 minute drive away; or a safe cycle along the green way and quiet
agricultural roads.

Walking just 150 metres from the house one arrives at the Jura mountain
forest. Local ski stations are just 10 minutes drive and the Alps can be
reached in about 1 hour by car.
