  ## A beautiful home to fall in love with ❤️

A lovely family home in Thoiry is offered for rent.

This wonderfully restored *maison de village* in Fenières, Thoiry, Pay de Gex, was
originally built in 1835. Thoroughly renovated, it offers spacious family
accommodation, with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, an additional toilet, and a large open-plan
kitchen/dining-room/living-room for sociable living. A mezzanine and balcony
complement the living spaces of 149m<sup>2</sup> in the house. The house is open on three sides,
filled with bright natural light during the day.

A 125m<sup>2</sup> garden space opposite the house is perfect for *al-fresco* dining and
enjoying fine weather. There is a carport, a large garden shed and space to
store firewood and other garden tools.
