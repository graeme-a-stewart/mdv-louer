# House Website

This is the Hugo website for *renting* my house in France.

It's a modified version of the
[*Magnolia*](https://github.com/ololiuhqui/magnolia-free-hugo-theme) theme by
Ludovico Caluori. Many thanks to him!

## Important Note

To build this website *locally* it is necessary to have the relevant NPM
modules installed. These can be copied from the Magnolia test site, or setup
with, e.g., `npm`.
